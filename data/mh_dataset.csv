Social Media Post,Depressed or not?
"I don’t need you to tell me to ‘stop worrying’. I will always worry.

Ah depression and anxiety, my two controversial friends that have placed me in a non-consensual three-way relationship which is often very difficult to deal with. I can wake up some days and feel like I’m ready to take on anything. But on one side of the bed, I’ll have my anxiety badgering me about the million and one things that will go wrong today.",Yes
"I had never heard of the word anxiety. I had heard of depression but didn’t understand it, and at that point, I never thought it would hit me.

In 2012 I graduated with a 2:1 degree, made amazing friends and I was working for a company I loved. Unfortunately, things didn’t work out where I was working and I decided to leave my job and search for another one. It was a hard decision walking away from the company I loved but I knew I had my education and experience on my side.",Yes
"Leading up to the day I opened up about my mental health I had struggled with anxiety for many years. It affected me in many ways and eventually opened the door for depression to come in, which would then take hold of my life for over a year. Throughout that time trying to deal with my anxiety and depression brought with it a lot of negative habits.",Yes
"I’ve struggled with mental health problems for 4 years now. I started my first year at college, being that independent person my parents always wanted me to be, but then everything just came tumbling down. My family and I all went through a very traumatic time and that’s where it all began.",Yes
" was diagnosed with depression during my final year of medical school. Since then it’s been a struggle of relapses and recovery. Sharing my story makes things easier. If I tell you my experience it’s easier for you to share yours.

I remember I wrote a sort of suicide note when I was 12. At that age I self-harmed as well. I didn’t speak to anyone about how I was feeling. What was I going to say? 

That was the first time I started feeling something wasn’t right, but I didn’t know what it was. Even at medical school, I still couldn’t figure it out.",Yes
"Depression and anxiety is a part of my life. I recognise now that it has been for the majority of my life. But it took a long time for me to realise and accept this. I didn't want to be ""ill"". The stigma surrounding mental illness was built within me, passed down through generations of people ""pulling themselves together"".",Yes
"I’ve always been rather private when it comes to my mental health. In 2019 I am willing to change that. I really wish mental health wasn’t such a taboo subject and that people did not feel ashamed to speak of their struggles, because it’s not our fault. But that’s the issue with mental illnesses, they cause you to overthink and you end up thinking it is your fault. It’s not.",Yes

"I don't go by or change my attitude based on what people say. At the end of the day, they, too, are judging me from their perspective. I would rather be myself and let people accept me for what I am than be somebody who I am not, just because I want people's approval.",No
I surround myself with good people who make me feel great and give me positive energy.,No
"Successful people maintain a positive focus in life no matter what is going on around them. They stay focused on their past successes rather than their past failures, and on the next action steps they need to take to get them closer to the fulfillment of their goals rather than all the other distractions that life presents to them.",No
"To be a champion, I think you have to see the big picture. It's not about winning and losing; it's about every day hard work and about thriving on a challenge. It's about embracing the pain that you'll experience at the end of a race and not being afraid. I think people think too hard and get afraid of a certain challenge.",No
"the real reason why you're sad? you're attached to people who have been distant with you. you're paying attention to people who ignore you. you make time for people who are ""too busy"" for you. you're too caring to people who are care less when it comes to you. let those people go",Yes
i cannot make you understand. i cannot make anyone understand what is happening inside me. i cannot even explain it to myself.,Yes
i don't think anyone really understands how tiring it is to act okay and always be the 'strong' one when in reality you're close to the edge.,Yes
"The worst feeling is when something is killing you inside, and you have to act like you don't care.",Yes
"when i’m hurt, i shut down, i turn into a total bitch i shut off my emotions i act differently towards everything and everyone and i hate it.",Yes
"over-thinking ruins you. ruins the situation, twists things around, makes you worry and just makes everything much worse than it actually is.",Yes
i'm disappointed in myself.. because i know i'm better than the choices i keep making and the things i choose to deal with.,Yes
"i'm just so tired of this. my body is tired, my mind is a mess. i just really want to lay in bed and never get up. i'm just so tired of life.",Yes
i'm sick of making things worse i'm sick of being hurt i'm sick of crying myself to sleep i’m sick of hating everything i'm sick of faking a smile i'm sick of feeling this way i’m sick of letting people down i'm sick of being me.,Yes
